## What is Lofft about üè†
In 2023, we are facing a massive housing and accomodation crisis. Over the past few years the avaibale supply of accomodation has been reduced, while the cost of renting has increased, in some areas at an alarming rate. These pressures are pushing people out of cities and into suburbs and regions outside of the city core. The current online offerings are profit driven, and populated by expired or landlords that are saturated by requests. 

Lofft is an indipendent open source application, built by a community and is non profit driven. As a web and mobile application, it is built to support renters and landlords to make it easier to find accomdation and manage the on boarding process. By keeping the application as a non profit social enterprise, it keeps the costs of development down, while encouraging a community to work on its development and contribute towards a cause that many people, including the founders of lofft face. 

## Development üíª

Welcome to the Lofft github guide, use this page to find out all the information that you require to work on and develop the Lofft platforms. We are currently working on the primary mobile MVP. The application is a web application, with a mobile application.
